This study (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6559271/) by Frisbee, Heidel, and Rasnake (2019) found that patients admitted with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) who were treated with intravenous antibiotics experienced longer hospital stays, increased need for diuretics, and higher rates of readmission compared to ADHF patients who did not receive this therapy. These findings underscore the importance of avoiding unnecessary intravenous antimicrobial therapy in patients with a low risk of pneumonia.

Sodium content data was taken from here (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6916518/table/T1/). The "Total Sodium (mg) per Day of Therapy" was divided by "(No. of Doses)" to get the Total Sodium (mg) per Dose. For antibiotics where two preparations were given, the results were averaged. I think the margin of error here is Â±200-500 mg. This calculator is in active development and I plan to make it more granular, and thus more accurate. I coded the "database" into the app, so if you inspect the webpage and look at the script elements you should be able to see the actual values.

Here is how to add the app to your mobile phone homepage, so it acts like a normal app (https://www.androidauthority.com/add-website-android-iphone-home-screen-3181682/) but if you're on GitHub then you probably don't need that.
